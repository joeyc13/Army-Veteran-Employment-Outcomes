In this project I am analyzing the career outcomes of enlisted soldiers who left the army at different times. The time period covered by this data set is the years 2000 - 2014.
The defining characteristics for each table name can be found at the above link. 

Currently, I have only studied the employment outcomes for soldiers who have left the Army based on their paygrade. 
I hope to expand my research to include employment outcomes based on time in service, age at Expiration - Term of Service (ETS), and Military Occupation Specialty (MOS).
